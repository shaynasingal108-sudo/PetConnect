## Overview
Social media is often generalised and doesn't specifically help pet owners. However, PetConnect is a website used to allow pet owners to connect and support one another efficiently. It allows users to communicate, grow, and educate themselves about their pets through an organized, trustowrthy, helpful manner. Through different tools like generative AI assistants, recommendations, quizzes, suggestions, as well as messaging, friends, posts, businesses, point systems, and more, users can collaborate and communicate easily and responsibly.

## Implementation
The application was built using Lovable, which handles the underlying
source code and deployment. This repository documents the project and
provides access to the live version.
